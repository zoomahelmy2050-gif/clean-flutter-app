```

### 5. **Deploy & Test**
```

2. Railway auto-deploys
3. Get your URL: https://your-project-name.up.railway.app
4. Test with: curl https://your-project-name.up.railway.app/health
```

### 6. **Update Flutter App**

```

### Test API:
```bash
curl https://your-project-name.up.railway.app/api
```

### PowerShell Test Script:
```powershell
.\test-deployment.ps1 -RailwayUrl "https://your-project-name.up.railway.app"
```

## âœ… **Success Indicators**
